## Dredd's Privacy Policy

### When inviting Dredd you accept with its privacy policy. The bot may store datas similar to guild id's, channel id's, nicknames. All the data is being logged by default and not togglable.

### Data is NOT being shared with anyone besides bot admin(s), and kept safe in the local database. If you (user) have any concerns about anything feel free to contact Moksej#3335 or mail moksej@gmail.com

### If you want that data to be removed you can leave the server, or ask bot staff to remove it by using their powers. Removing the bot from the server will also delete all the data it had collected while being in the guild.
