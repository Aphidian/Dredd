### What data do we store and why do we need it?

#### We currently store: 
- `user ids` - we store it for: blacklisting, suggestions, bot badges, todo lists, moderation purposes, activity status, command usage, partnerships, suggestions following, bot blacklist history, snipes.
- `guild ids` - we store it to make various bot features and the bot itself functional.

- `role ids` - we store it to make reaction roles, role on joins, mutes functional.
-  `message ids` - we store it for suggestions, moderation logging.
-  `message jump urls` - we store it for: todo lists, errors, edited messages loggin.

### Where do we store the data and who has access to it?

#### We use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/privacy/) database to store the data itself. Bot Developer(s) can access and modify the data at any given time. 

### Can I delete my data? What should I do if I have any concerns.

#### Yes, you can delete some of your data: 
- `todo clear` - will clear your todo list
- `toggle <option>` - will clear & toggle your nicknames and message sniping (nicknames that are older than 90 days will automatically get deleted)
- Server's data - once you kick the bot you'll be on a 30 (thirty) days grace period during which your server's data will not be deleted and you'll get to keep the data upon re-invite.
#### If you have any concers or want your **all** of your data deleted, you'll need to contact us by either [joining our support server](https://dredd-bot.xyz/support) and opening a ticket or sending us an email at support@dredd-bot.xyz. Keep in mind we cannot delete certain data, that includes:
- Moderation actions - we cannot delete this without one of the server administrator's request.
- Non-appealable blacklist - if you were blacklisted and can't appeal, unfortunately, that means the data will stay and you won't be unblacklisted ever.
- Server's grace period - we can actually delete this, but only by the server's owner request.
- Command usage - we log command usages to know how many commands where used in a certain period of time, without a proper reasoning, this will not be deleted. *It also depends on the majority of commands used, if the number is too small (<100), we'll gladly delete it, but if the number is too big (>100) you'll need to provide a strong reason as to why you want the data to be removed*
#### If you've opened a ticket or mailed us, it can take up to 5 (five) work days until we gather and delete all of your data.
